Android program to toggle wifi, gps, and set screen brightness. It's a full activity, not a widget. Supports the 1.5 API. Yes, this is a shameless clone of PowerManager.

BTW: This is the exact same app listed as "Toggle ME" in the android market. Please note: The "author" of "Toggle ME" just downloaded this code and is selling it. DO NOT PAY FOR IT. This code always has been and always be FREE.
